The C projects in this repository are from 42 USA. These projects have developed my fundamental understanding of the C programming language. The included projects teach the disciplines of managing memory, building data structures and  algorithms.

libft: Recode functions from the standard C library in addition to custom functions that are the building blocks of the projects that follow.

fillit: The goal is to search for an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time period. This fillit program utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the single correct solution of placing tetriminos in the smallest square possible.
